## 🎯 Wave 3 Expansion: Units 76-90

These units complete the tense system and add critical grammar structures:

#### **Unit 76: Future Tense (Farei, Fará)**

- **Formation:** infinitive + -ei/-á/-emos/-ão
- **Only 3 irregulars:** fazer → farei, dizer → direi, trazer → trarei
- **Use:** Formal predictions, uncertain future, formal writing

- **Key:** BP heavily prefers "vou + infinitive" in speech

#### **Unit 77: Conditional Tense (Faria, Gostaria)**
- **Drill:** conditional-tense.json
- **Formation:** infinitive + -ia/-ia/-íamos/-iam
- **Same 3 irregulars** as future tense

  - Polite requests: "Gostaria de um café" (I would like a coffee)
  - Hypotheticals: "Eu faria isso, mas..." (I would do that, but...)
  - Advice: "Você deveria descansar" (You should rest)
- **Key:** Essential for politeness - "gostaria de" extremely common

#### **Unit 78: É que - Emphatic Questions**
