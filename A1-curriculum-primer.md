# A1 Portuguese Curriculum Primer

## Overview

This primer explains the A1-level curriculum offered by Portuguese Language Drills. The A1 level represents the foundation of Portuguese language learning, covering essential grammar structures, basic verb conjugations, and fundamental sentence construction. Each drill below is designed to build proficiency through focused, repetitive practice.

All drills support both Brazilian Portuguese (BP) and European Portuguese (EP), allowing learners to choose their preferred dialect.

## 1. Self-Introduction Drill

**What You'll Learn:**
Build your first sentences in Portuguese for introducing yourself. This is the entry point for absolute beginners.

**Core Skill:**
Practice the first-person singular (eu) with essential self-introduction phrases:
- "I am [name]" - (Eu) sou o/a [Name]
- "I am a [profession]" - (Eu) sou [profession]
- "I am [nationality]" - (Eu) sou [nationality]
- "I am from [city]" - (Eu) sou de [city]
- "I live in [city]" - (Eu) moro em [city]
- "I speak [language]" - (Eu) falo [language]
- "I work at [place]" - (Eu) trabalho em/no/na [place]

**Key Grammar Point:**
In Brazilian Portuguese, the pronoun "Eu" (I) is often omitted in conversation because verb endings are unique. For example, "sou" automatically means "I am," so saying just "Sou professor" sounds natural and conversational.

**Progressive Learning:**
After each correct sentence, the drill provides a recap of all sentences you've built, creating a complete self-introduction paragraph.

## 2. Regular -AR Verbs

**What You'll Learn:**
Master the present and simple past tenses for regular Portuguese verbs ending in -ar. This is the largest and most common verb group in Portuguese.

**Verb Examples:**
The drill includes 100+ approved verbs such as: falar, trabalhar, morar, estudar, comprar, cantar, and many more.

**Practice Format:**
Fill-in-the-blank exercises with English context sentences and Portuguese sentences with a blank for the conjugated verb. You'll practice all subject pronouns (eu, você, ele/ela, nós, eles/vocês) in both present and simple past tenses.

**Focus Options:**
You can request to focus on:
- Present tense only or past tense only
- A specific verb (e.g., "let's practice 'falar'")
- A specific subject/conjugation (e.g., "focus on 'nós'")

**Dialect Differences:**
- BP mode uses "você" and "vocês" for "you" and occasionally uses "a gente" for "we"
- EP mode frequently uses "tu" for singular "you"

---

## 3. Regular -ER Verbs

**What You'll Learn:**
Master the present and simple past tenses for regular Portuguese verbs ending in -er. This is the second major verb conjugation pattern.

**Verb Examples:**
34 approved verbs including: comer, beber, correr, vender, aprender, compreender, and others.

**Practice Format:**
Same fill-in-the-blank format as -AR verbs, testing all subject pronouns in both present and simple past tenses.

**Key Feature:**
Provides detailed feedback with full conjugation tables and usage notes explaining the verb's meaning and any prepositions it requires.

---

## 4. Regular -IR Verbs

**What You'll Learn:**
Master the present and simple past tenses for regular Portuguese verbs ending in -ir. This is the third regular verb conjugation pattern.

**Verb Examples:**
12 approved verbs including: abrir, assistir, decidir, partir, existir, insistir, and others.

**Special Note on Assistir:**
The drill includes preposition practice, especially for "assistir a" (to watch), which requires the preposition "a."

**Practice Format:**
Fill-in-the-blank exercises with comprehensive feedback including conjugation tables and usage notes for each verb.

---

## 5. Irregular Verbs

**What You'll Learn:**
Master the most common and important irregular verbs in Portuguese. These verbs don't follow regular patterns and must be memorized through practice.

**Essential Irregular Verbs:**
The drill covers 14 critical verbs: ser, estar, ir, vir, ter, fazer, dizer, poder, pôr, querer, saber, ver, dar, trazer.

**Why This Matters:**
These irregular verbs are among the most frequently used words in Portuguese. Mastering them is essential for basic conversation.

**Practice Format:**
- Two-line format: English sentence + Portuguese sentence with blank
- Includes two-verb phrase exercises (infinitive practice)
- Mix of statements, questions, and negative sentences
- Clear time indicators for verbs with ambiguous tenses (especially "pôr")

**Special Features:**
- Video links for certain verbs (ser, dar) when practicing present tense
- Detailed feedback on ser vs. estar usage
- Comprehensive conjugation tables for both BP and EP modes

---

## 6. Ser vs Estar

**What You'll Learn:**
Master the crucial difference between the two "to be" verbs in Portuguese: ser and estar. This is one of the most important distinctions in the language.

**Core Distinction:**
- **Ser:** Used for inherent qualities, professions, nationalities, descriptions, and location of events
  - Example: "She is a doctor" (Ela é médica)
  - Example: "The party is at my house" (A festa é na minha casa)

- **Estar:** Used for moods, locations of people/objects, or states that result from change
  - Example: "He is tired" (Ele está cansado)
  - Example: "My book is on the table" (Meu livro está na mesa)
  - Example: "He is old" (Ele está velho - meaning he became old)

**Ambiguous Cases:**
About 1 in 4 questions tests adjectives that can use either verb with different meanings:
- Adjectives like bom, bonito, feliz, chato can change meaning based on which verb is used

**Special Answer Option:**
When you recognize an ambiguous case, you can answer "both," and the drill will explain the nuanced difference in meaning.

**Practice Format:**
Simple fill-in-the-blank exercises with clear feedback explaining the rule and when ambiguity exists.

## 7. Immediate Future

**What You'll Learn:**
Master the Immediate Future tense using "ir + infinitive." This is the most common way to talk about the future in conversational Portuguese.

**Grammar Structure:**
Portuguese: ir (conjugated) + infinitive verb
English equivalent: "going to + verb"

**Example:**
- English: "I am going to speak with her"
- Portuguese: "Eu vou falar com ela"

**What You Practice:**
Conjugating the irregular verb "ir" in the present tense with various subjects, followed by infinitive verbs from an extensive approved list (100+ verbs).

**Spanish Analogy:**
Each exercise includes a comparison to Spanish to help learners who know Spanish:
- "eu vou" is similar to Spanish "yo voy"
- "você vai" is like "usted va"
- "nós vamos" is almost identical to "nosotros vamos"

**Key Difference from Spanish:**
Portuguese uses "ir + infinitive" while Spanish uses "ir a + infinitive" (with the preposition "a").

---

## 8. Ir + Transportation

**What You'll Learn:**
Practice using the verb IR with different modes of transportation. This is essential for describing how you travel.

**Core Pattern:**
Subject + ir (conjugated) + de + [mode of transport]

**Examples:**
- "Eu vou de carro" (I go by car)
- "Ela vai de ônibus" (She goes by bus)
- "Nós vamos de bicicleta" (We go by bike)

**Exception:**
"A pé" (on foot) uses the preposition "a" instead of "de"

**Approved Transportation List:**
21 modes of transport including: a pé, avião, barco, bicicleta, carro, metrô, ônibus, táxi, trem, Uber, and more.

**Practice Format:**
Two-blank exercises where you provide both the conjugated form of "ir" and the transportation phrase.

**Feedback Includes:**
Full conjugation tables showing all subject pronouns with the specific transportation mode from the exercise.

---

## 9. Noun Plurals

**What You'll Learn:**
Master the rules for forming noun plurals in Portuguese. While many words simply add "-s," there are several special endings to learn.

**Key Plural Rules:**

1. **Vowel endings** → add -s
   - livro → livros (books)
   - casa → casas (houses)

2. **Endings in -r or -z** → add -es
   - mulher → mulheres (women)
   - luz → luzes (lights)

3. **Endings in -m** → change to -ns
   - homem → homens (men)
   - jardim → jardins (gardens)

4. **Endings in -ão** → most commonly change to -ões
   - lição → lições (lessons)
   - coração → corações (hearts)

5. **Endings in -l** → change to -is
   - animal → animais (animals)
   - papel → papéis (papers)

**Practice Structure:**
- First exercise is always a simple vowel ending (add -s rule)
- Then 50% simple cases, 50% complex cases
- Each feedback includes 2-3 additional examples and a Spanish analogy

**Spanish Analogies:**
The drill consistently compares Portuguese plural rules to Spanish to highlight similarities and key differences.

## 10. Adjective Agreement

**What You'll Learn:**
Master adjective agreement in Portuguese. Adjectives must match the gender (masculine/feminine) and number (singular/plural) of the nouns they describe.

**Core Rules:**

1. **Adjectives ending in -o:**
   - Masculine singular: novo
   - Feminine singular: nova
   - Masculine plural: novos
   - Feminine plural: novas

2. **Invariable adjectives** (ending in -e, -l, -z, etc.):
   - Don't change for gender
   - Only add -s for plural
   - Example: inteligente → inteligentes

**Practice Format:**
Fill-in-the-blank exercises with simple sentences (typically using ser or estar) where you adjust the adjective to match the noun.

**First Question:**
The first exercise always tests a simple masculine singular adjective ending in -o.

**Grammatical Isolation:**
The Portuguese sentences are constructed so only the adjective changes - no articles or other words need adjustment.

**Approved Adjectives List:**
43 common adjectives including: alto, bonito, feliz, inteligente, novo, velho, grande, pequeno, and many more.

---

## 11. Contractions with Articles (de/em)

**What You'll Learn:**
Master how the Portuguese prepositions "de" (from/of) and "em" (in/on/at) contract with definite articles to form words like do, da, no, and na.

**Contraction Tables:**

**de + articles:**
- de + o = do
- de + a = da
- de + os = dos
- de + as = das

**em + articles:**
- em + o = no
- em + a = na
- em + os = nos
- em + as = nas

**Examples:**
- "Eu gosto do livro" (I like the book) - de + o = do
- "Eu moro na cidade" (I live in the city) - em + a = na

**Important Exceptions:**
Not all nouns take articles, so no contraction forms:
- "em casa" (at home) - fixed expression without article
- "em São Paulo" (in São Paulo) - most city names don't use articles
- "de Portugal" (from Portugal) - some countries don't use articles

**Exception to the Exception:**
"o Rio de Janeiro" does require contractions: "no Rio" (in Rio), "do Rio" (from Rio)

**Practice Format:**
Fill-in-the-blank exercises with options provided (e.g., "de, do, da" or "em, no, na")

**Spanish Contrast:**
A major difference from Spanish! While Spanish only has one contraction (del = de + el), Portuguese contracts de and em with all forms of the definite article (o, a, os, as).
