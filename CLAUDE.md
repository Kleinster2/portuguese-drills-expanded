## UI Structure

**Navigation**: Sticky nav bar on all pages linking to Home, Diagnostic, Drills, Simplifier, Curriculum.

**Homepage Dashboard**: Feature cards linking to each tool, followed by drills section with search/filters.

**Pages**:
- `/` - Dashboard + Drills
- `/diagnostic-test.html` - Proficiency assessment
- `/simplifier.html` - Text simplification tool
- `/syllabus.html` - Pronunciation curriculum

## Quick Start

```bash
npx wrangler pages dev .                                    # Local dev
npx wrangler pages deploy . --project-name=portuguese-drills-expanded  # Deploy
```

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Cloudflare Pages environment variables.

## CRITICAL: Editing Drill Prompts

**Drill prompts are BUNDLED.** The app loads from `utils/promptData.generated.js`, NOT directly from the JSON files.

After editing ANY file in `config/prompts/`:

```bash
npm run build    # Regenerate the bundle from JSON files
npx wrangler pages deploy . --project-name=portuguese-drills-expanded
```

**If you skip `npm run build`, your changes will NOT appear on the live site!**

The bundle is generated by `scripts/build-prompts.js` and combines all 70+ drill JSON files into one JS module for faster loading.

## Curriculum Design Principles

**Units** = curriculum topics (what should be taught)
**Drills** = JSON files in `config/prompts/` that implement practice exercises

A unit may not have a corresponding drill yet.

### Atomic Focus
Each unit should target ONE specific concept. When in doubt, split rather than combine.

**Examples:**
- Saber vs Conhecer → one unit (single distinction)
- Aspectual shifts (saber, conhecer, poder, querer) → four separate units, not one combined
- Pôr derivatives → one unit (single pattern applied to many verbs)

**Rationale:**
- Focused practice builds stronger retention
- Learners can target specific weaknesses
- Progress tracking is more granular
- Units can be combined in multi-drill sessions when broader practice is needed

### CEFR Alignment
Curriculum follows CEFR levels (A1-B2). See:
- [A1 Curriculum](docs/drills/A1-curriculum-primer.md) - 25 units
- [A2 Curriculum](docs/drills/A2-curriculum-primer.md) - 28 units
- [B1 Curriculum](docs/drills/B1-curriculum-primer.md) - 24 units
- [B2 Curriculum](docs/drills/B2-curriculum-primer.md) - 22 units

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML + Tailwind CSS (CDN, no build)
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Pages Functions
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude API
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages
- **Testing**: Playwright

## Testing

```bash
npm test                           # All tests (Python + JS consistency)
npm run test:js                    # JavaScript tests only
npx playwright test tests/ui.spec.js  # UI tests (nav, dashboard, drills)
```

### UI Tests (Playwright)
- Navigation bar appears on all pages
- Nav links work correctly
- Dashboard feature cards visible and clickable
- Drills section has search and filters

## Editing Content

**Drills**:
1. Edit `config/prompts/[drill].json`
2. Run `npm run build` ← **REQUIRED! Rebuilds the bundle**
3. Deploy with `npx wrangler pages deploy . --project-name=portuguese-drills-expanded`

**Pronunciation**: Write clean Portuguese → run through annotation tool → get annotated output
