### Pronunciation Guide

**"Why the weird brackets?"**

Simple explanation for students:
```
You might notice symbols like [_u_] and [_dji_] in some answers.

These show you how Brazilians ACTUALLY pronounce words:

📝 Written: Eu trabalho no hospital
🗣️ Spoken: Eu trabalho[_u_] no[_u_] hospita~~l~~[_u_]

The [_u_] tells you:
"This 'o' sounds like 'oo' in 'book', not 'oh'"

You don't need to memorize these!
Just notice them and your ear will get used to Brazilian pronunciation naturally.
