## Notes

- Pattern of mutual slow replies on both sides
- Multiple failed attempts to schedule a phone call (Dec 2024)
- Likely corporate-funded: Rafael needs approval, Gil mentioned "your firm" and offered a formal proposal
- Rate quoted: $70/class (up to 90 min), or $63/lesson in 5-pack ($315)
- May be worth a follow-up if re-engagement is desired
