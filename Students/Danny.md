## Notes

- Two engagement windows: Apr 2025 and Aug 2025, both fizzled
- Gil never quoted a specific dollar rate — said it depends on frequency/location/time
- Gil proposed a phone call or Zoom both times; never happened (as far as email shows)
- May be worth a follow-up if re-engagement is desired
- Gil's proposed approach: mix of structured grammar/vocabulary work and speaking practice focused on natural everyday speech, pronunciation, contractions
