**Full name:** Marvin Michel

## Goals

- Conversational speaking and listening
- Grammar improvement, especially writing and reading
- Personalized lessons beyond what group classes (POLI Institute) offered

---

## Current focus

- Imperativo (affirmative and negative)

---

## Strengths

- Communicates scheduling in Portuguese naturally (uses tenses, time expressions, polite forms)
- Good use of "desculpe/desculpe-me", "sem problemas", "obrigado"
- Attempts complex sentences ("Eu acho que seria bom de anular esta semana")
- Uses tu-form conjugations (European Portuguese preference)

---

## Trouble spots

- Gender agreement ("um pergunta" → uma, "um gripe" → uma)
- Ser/Estar confusion ("sou disponível" → estou disponível)
- Preposition usage ("desculpas por que" → porque)
- Clitic placement ("quero dar-los" → dá-los / quero dá-los)
- "Muito desculpe" → "Muita desculpa" or "Desculpe muito"
