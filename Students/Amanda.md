## Goals

- Conversational fluency in Portuguese
- Comfortable reading/writing in daily contexts
- Improve tenses beyond present and future (self-identified weakness from 2022)

---

## Current focus

- Adv Beg 9 worksheet (reflexive/reciprocal verbs, superlatives, ouvir/pedir, acabar de, mal+verbo, precisar/ter que/ter de)

---

## Strengths

- Writes naturally in Portuguese with good sentence structure
- Initiates conversation in Portuguese unprompted
- Good vocabulary for daily life topics
- Self-corrects (e.g., "me" → "mim", "na sexta" correction)
- Comfortable sharing links/content in Portuguese (shared Sanna Marin video)

---

## Trouble spots

- Minor spelling: "voçe" (should be "você"), "boms" (should be "bons"), "días" (Spanish influence — should be "dias"), "brigada" (should be "obrigada")
- Occasional gender/number agreement slips
- Preposition usage: "Perfeito para me!" → "para mim"
- "no segundo" → "na segunda" (weekday gender)
- "veo" → "vejo" (irregular verb ver)
- Doesn't have TikTok — can't view TikTok links
