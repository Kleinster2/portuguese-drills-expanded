## Notes

- Previous student — relationship already established
- Looking for multi-month commitment ("over the next several months")
- Area code 925 is East Bay, California — may need online classes or could be in NYC now
- No visible reply from Gil as of this thread
- May be worth prioritizing as a warm lead / returning student
