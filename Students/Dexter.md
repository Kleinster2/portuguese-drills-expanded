Hi Gilberto, I am inquiring about the pricing/scheduling of Portuguese private lessons with you. I am a native English speaker and speak Spanish. How much are lessons and how often would we meet? Is there "homework" outside of class or what is the layout of classes?

Thank you,
Dexter

### 2026-02-16 — Gil → Dexter

Hi Dexter,

Thank you for your message. I'd be glad to help you get started with Portuguese. Your background in Spanish will give you a real head start — There are many similarities, and I can guide you through the key differences.

I'm a native speaker from São Paulo, Brazil, and I teach both online and in person in New York City.

My rate is $70 per session, with each session running up to 90 minutes. I usually recommend meeting once a week, which gives you time to absorb and practice between sessions.

Each lesson is a mix of structured work — grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation — and speaking practice focused on how Brazilians actually express themselves in everyday conversation. I use my own materials and adapt content tailored to your level and interests, rather than following a single textbook.

I do provide exercises and materials to work on between classes, but it's always flexible depending on your schedule.

I'd be happy to chat over the phone if you'd like to discuss your goals in more detail. My number is (212) 470-9062.

Abraços,
Gil

Hi Gil,

This sounds great! What does your availability look like in the upcoming weeks? I generally work 9a-5p, but sometimes will go later. If possible, a weeknight with a 6-7p start time would be best for me.

I think the best plan for me would be to start with one or a couple lessons to see if this teaching style works for me. Do you offer a preliminary lesson? Or do you recommend starting with 2-3 lessons and then going from there?

Thanks,
Dexter

### 2026-02-24 — Gil → Dexter

Hi Dexter,

Great to hear.

Weeknight evenings work well for me. I can do 6pm or 6:30pm starts — let me know which days tend to be most consistent for you and we'll lock one in.

The first session is a regular lesson, so we'll get into real material right away and you can see how the format feels. No commitment beyond that — if it works, we keep going.

I usually meet at a quiet spot that is convenient to the student. Let me know what neighborhood you're in and I can suggest a few places — or feel free to suggest one yourself.

Want to meet next week? Just send me a few dates that work and we'll pick one.

Looking forward to our session.

Abraços,
Gil

Hi Gil,

Exciting! This all sounds great. I live in Bedstuy in Brooklyn, but am not aware of many late-night spots near me. If you know of any I'd be happy to meet you there.

Wednesday and Thursday (3/4 and 3/5) should work. 6:30pm would be a safer bet. Let me know which day works for you.

Best,
Dexter

### 2026-02-25 — Gil → Dexter

Olá Dexter,

Thanks for getting back to me. Let's do Thursday, 3/5, at 6:30 pm. Here are a few spots in Bed-Stuy that look like they could work for a lesson:

- Commune NYC — Lexington Ave & Monroe St (cafe/wine bar, open till 10 pm)
- Therapy Wine Bar — 1159 Bedford Ave
- Barb's — 380 Marcus Garvey Blvd
- Frog — 503 Nostrand Ave

If you have somewhere else in mind — a cafe, a bar, whatever works — I'm open. I'm about 20 minutes away on the J train, so anywhere in the neighborhood works for me.

Abraços,
Gil

### 2026-02-25 — Dexter → Gil

Hi Gil,

Let's meet at Frog! Is there anything specific I should bring?

Thanks,
Dexter

### 2026-02-26 — Gil → Dexter

Oi Dexter,

Frog works. Let's meet there. Just bring yourself. I'll have everything we need for the lesson.

See you Thursday at 6:30!

Abraços,
Gil

### 2026-02-26 — Gil → Dexter

Oi Dexter,

I gave you the wrong address for Frog in my earlier email — sorry about that.
It's actually at 358 Marcus Garvey Blvd, not 503 Nostrand Ave.
If that's less convenient for you, we can meet elsewhere — just let me know.

See you Thursday at 6:30!

Abraços,
Gil
