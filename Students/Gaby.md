## Notes

- Two-person class setup similar to Rachel & Nicholas
- Preferred group classes but open to semi-private (two-person)
- Wanted to start within a month of inquiry (Nov 2025)
- Different starting levels: Gaby has passive exposure + French background; Michael is true beginner
- Level mismatch could be a consideration for lesson planning
- No visible reply — may be worth a belated follow-up if still interested
