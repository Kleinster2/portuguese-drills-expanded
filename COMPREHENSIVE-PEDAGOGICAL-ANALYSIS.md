---

## 1. Coverage Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (35 Units with 0 Questions)

#### A1 Phase (7 untested units)
- **Unit 14:** Family Vocabulary (mãe, pai, irmão)
- **Unit 17:** Colors (cores)
- **Unit 18:** Days of the Week
- **Unit 19:** Gostar de - Expressing Likes
- **Unit 20:** Body Parts (partes do corpo)
- **Unit 22:** Regular -ER Verbs (Comer, Beber)
- **Unit 23:** 3rd Person Singular (Ele/Ela fala)

**Impact:** Missing fundamental vocabulary topics (family, colors, days, body parts) limits ability to assess true beginner competency. These are essential A1 building blocks.

#### A2 Phase (8 untested units)
- **Unit 31:** Haver - Existence (Há, Havia)
- **Unit 50:** Superlatives (o mais..., o menos...)
- **Unit 51:** Irregular Comparatives (melhor, pior, maior)
- **Unit 52:** Absolute Superlatives (-íssimo)
- **Unit 53:** Diminutives (-inho, -zinho)
- **Unit 54:** Augmentatives (-ão, -ona)
- **Unit 55:** Months, Dates & Telling Time

**Impact:** Missing critical grammar points (superlatives, comparatives, haver) and practical vocabulary (dates, time). This creates a gap in assessing A2 completion.

#### B1 Phase (12 untested units)
- **Unit 56:** Demonstratives (este, esse, aquele) ⚠️
- **Unit 57:** Indefinite Pronouns (alguém, algo, nenhum)
- **Unit 58:** Indefinite Pronouns (qualquer, cada, outro)
- **Unit 61:** Próclise with Adverbs (sempre me)
- **Unit 64:** Verb + Preposition: Depender de, Gostar de
- **Unit 65:** Relative Pronoun: Que (basic)
- **Unit 66:** Relative Pronoun: Onde (where)
- **Unit 67:** Relative Pronoun: Quem (who)
- **Unit 69:** Relative Pronoun: O que (what/that which)
- **Unit 70:** Preposition + Que (em que, com que)
- **Unit 72:** Compound Past: Ter + Participle (tenho feito)
- **Unit 73:** Pluperfect: Tinha + Participle (tinha feito)
- **Unit 74:** Reported Speech (Ele disse que...)
- **Unit 77:** SE Passive (Fala-se português)

**Impact:** CRITICAL - Missing demonstratives (Unit 56) despite having a "Demonstratives" question (Q239, Unit 71). Missing most relative pronouns creates a major gap in B1 assessment. These are core intermediate grammar structures.

⚠️ **Note:** There appears to be a unit numbering discrepancy. Q239 is labeled as testing "Demonstratives" but assigned to Unit 71, while the syllabus places Demonstratives at Unit 56.

#### B2 Phase (8 untested units)
- **Unit 81:** Simple Future (Farei, Fará)
- **Unit 87:** Time Expressions (há, faz, desde)
- **Unit 88:** Todo vs Tudo
- **Unit 93:** Imperfect Subjunctive (Se eu fosse)
- **Unit 94:** Future Subjunctive (Quando eu for)
- **Unit 98:** Ficar + Gerúndio (kept doing)
- **Unit 99:** Colloquial Contractions (pra, tá, né)

**Impact:** Missing key subjunctive variations (imperfect, future) and practical language features (colloquial contractions, todo/tudo distinction).

### Under-Represented Units (20 Units with Only 1 Question)

These units have minimal coverage, which may not provide sufficient diagnostic signal:

#### A1 Phase (6 units)
- Unit 7: Muito Agreement
- Unit 8: Regular -AR Verbs: Morar, Falar
- Unit 9: Prepositions em/no/na
- Unit 10: Regular -AR Verbs: Trabalhar, Estudar
- Unit 13: Location Prepositions
- Unit 15: Food & Drinks Vocabulary

#### A2 Phase (2 units)
- Unit 32: Possessives: Meu/Minha, Seu/Sua
- Unit 49: Comparatives (mais...que, menos...que)

#### B1 Phase (4 units)
- Unit 59: Indirect Object Pronouns
- Unit 60: Próclise with Negatives
- Unit 62: Pronouns after Infinitives
- Unit 63: Verb + Preposition: Pensar em, Sonhar com
- Unit 68: Relative Pronoun: Cujo

#### B2 Phase (8 units)
- Unit 86: Aspectual Verbs
- Unit 89: Present Subjunctive - Regular
- Unit 90: Present Subjunctive - Irregular
- Unit 91: Subjunctive Triggers: Querer que, Espero que
- Unit 92: Subjunctive Triggers: Talvez, Embora, Caso
- Unit 97: Progressive Periphrases
- Unit 100: Comprehensive Review & Synthesis

**Recommendation:** Consider adding 1-2 additional questions for each of these units to increase diagnostic reliability.

### Over-Represented Units (1 Unit with 5+ Questions)

- **Unit 43:** Para vs Por - Basic Uses (6 questions)

**Assessment:** This appears appropriate given the difficulty and importance of para/por distinction. Over-representation is not a concern here.

## 2. Phase Balance Analysis

### Distribution

| Phase | Questions | % of Total | Syllabus Units | Q per Unit | Assessment |
|-------|-----------|------------|----------------|------------|------------|
| **A1** | 28 | 19.7% | 25 | 1.1 | Slightly under-represented |
| **A2** | 63 | 44.4% | 30 | 2.1 | Well-represented |
| **B1** | 23 | 16.2% | 25 | 0.9 | Under-represented |
| **B2** | 28 | 19.7% | 20 | 1.4 | Adequately represented |

### Analysis

**Strengths:**
- A2 phase has strong coverage (2.1 questions per unit average)
- B2 maintains decent coverage despite fewer syllabus units
- Total distribution follows a bell curve centered on A2, which is pedagogically sound

**Concerns:**
- **A1 under-representation (1.1 q/unit):** May not provide sufficient signal for true beginners
- **B1 significantly under-represented (0.9 q/unit):** Only 23 questions for 25 units, with 12 units completely untested
- The B1 gap is particularly problematic as it's the bridge between elementary and advanced Portuguese

**Recommendation:**
- Add 5-10 A1 questions (prioritizing vocabulary: family, colors, days, body parts)
- Add 10-15 B1 questions (prioritizing demonstratives, relative pronouns, compound tenses)

## 4. Pedagogical Quality Assessment

### Sample Analysis (32 Questions)

#### 4.1 Scenario Quality

**Positive Findings:**
- ✅ No scenarios directly contain the correct answer
- ✅ Scenarios establish context without obvious telegraphing
- ✅ Good use of conversational contexts (e.g., "You are introducing yourself to a new group of friends in Brazil")

**Concerns:**
- None identified in sampled questions

**Sample Excellent Scenario:**
```
Q2: Identity Statements
EN: I am American (m/f)
Template: Eu __ americano/americana
Scenario: You are introducing yourself to a new group of friends in Brazil.
Chips: são, somos, fui, é, está, era, seria, sou, és, estou
Correct: sou
```
✅ **Analysis:** Scenario sets social context without hinting. Distractors include plausible tense/person errors.

#### 4.2 Demonstrative Questions

**Finding:** Limited demonstrative coverage, but existing question has good spatial context.

**Sample:**
```
Q239: Demonstratives
EN: This book is interesting
Template: __ livro é interessante
Scenario: You're pointing to a specific book among several in front of you.
Correct: Este
```
✅ **Analysis:** "Pointing to" and "among several in front of you" establishes proximal distance clearly.

**Recommendation:** Add 2-3 more demonstrative questions testing esse (medium distance) and aquele (far distance) with equally clear spatial markers.

#### 4.3 Ser vs. Estar Questions

**Issues Identified:** 2 questions (out of 32 sampled) may lack sufficient contextual clarity.

**Issue Example 1:**
```
Q214: Verb Estar
EN: The tomato is expensive.
Template: O tomate __ caro.
Scenario: Complaining about recent price increases at the market.
Correct: está (implied temporary state)
```
⚠️ **Analysis:** While "recent price increases" suggests temporary state, this is subtle. A learner might argue that the tomato's current price is a permanent characteristic of that tomato. Consider adding temporal marker like "hoje" or "agora" to make temporary nature unambiguous.

**Issue Example 2:**
```
Q112: Irregular Preterite - Ser/Ir
EN: Yesterday, we went there
Template: Nós __ lá
Scenario: Explaining that your group already went there yesterday.
```
⚠️ **Analysis:** This is flagged by the analysis script but is actually a preterite question (ser/ir conjugation), not a ser/estar choice question. The scenario is appropriate. This is a false positive.

**Recommendation:** Review all ser/estar questions (not just preterite ser/ir) to ensure scenarios clearly establish:
- Temporary vs. permanent nature
- Location vs. characteristic
- Current state vs. inherent quality

#### 4.4 Tense Selection Questions

**Issues Identified:** 3 questions may lack clear temporal markers.

**Issue Example:**
```
Q101: Preterite Tense - Regular -AR Verbs
EN: I spoke Portuguese
Template: Eu __ português
Scenario: You're recounting a completed event.
```
⚠️ **Analysis:** "Recounting a completed event" is pedagogically correct (preterite = completed action) but the scenario is meta-descriptive rather than contextual. Consider revising to: "You're telling a friend about the conversation you had at the embassy yesterday."

**Recommendation:** Ensure tense questions include:
- Specific time reference (yesterday, tomorrow, always, etc.)
- Contextual cues (habitual vs. one-time, completed vs. ongoing)
- Avoid meta-descriptions like "completed event" in scenarios

#### 4.5 Distractor Quality

**Findings:**
- ✅ No duplicate chips found (0 defects)
- ✅ Correct answer always present in chip options (0 defects)
- 56 instances of "very similar" distractors (e.g., sou vs. são, das vs. dos)

**Analysis:** Similar distractors are **pedagogically valuable** - they test fine distinctions in:
- Person agreement (eu vs. eles)
- Gender agreement (das vs. dos)
- Tense/mood distinctions (falo vs. falei vs. falava)

**Sample:**
```
Q2: Identity Statements
Chips: são, somos, fui, é, está, era, seria, sou, és, estou
Correct: sou

Similar distractors:
- "são" (3rd person plural - tests person agreement)
- "és" (2nd person singular - tests person agreement)
- "é" (3rd person singular - tests person agreement)
```
✅ **Assessment:** These distractors are pedagogically sound. They require learners to know precise conjugation patterns.

**No implausible distractors identified.** All chip options represent valid Portuguese verb forms or grammar structures.

#### 4.6 English-Portuguese Alignment

**Finding:** ✅ No mismatches identified in sampled questions.

All questions demonstrate proper alignment between:
- English plural indicators → Portuguese plural forms
- English tense markers → Portuguese tense requirements
- English gender hints → Portuguese gender options (when provided as m/f)

## 5. Specific Defect Scan (All 142 Questions)

### 5.1 Technical Defects

| Defect Type | Count | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| Correct answer missing from chips | 0 | ✅ PASS |
| Duplicate chips | 0 | ✅ PASS |
| Missing scenarios (where required) | 0 | ✅ PASS |

**Conclusion:** The question set has **zero technical defects**. All questions have:
- Correct answer included in chip options
- Unique chip options (no duplicates)
- Scenarios provided where contextually necessary

### 5.2 Consistency Check

**Unit Numbering:**
- ⚠️ Potential discrepancy: Q239 tests "Demonstratives" but is assigned Unit 71, while syllabus lists Demonstratives as Unit 56
- **Action Required:** Verify unit numbering alignment between questions and syllabus

| **B1 Diagnostic Accuracy** | 6/10 | Significant gaps in pronouns and compound tenses |
| **B2 Diagnostic Accuracy** | 7/10 | Good coverage but missing subjunctive variations |
| **Overall Test Quality** | 8/10 | Strong foundation, needs gap-filling |

---

## 9. Conclusion

### Overall Assessment: **Strong Foundation with Addressable Gaps**

The diagnostic test v10.9-no-hints demonstrates **excellent technical quality** and **strong pedagogical design** in its current questions. The zero-defect rate and thoughtful scenario design indicate careful construction.

However, **coverage gaps** limit diagnostic precision, particularly in:
- **A1:** Fundamental vocabulary (family, colors, days, body parts)
- **B1:** Relative pronouns, compound tenses, demonstratives, indefinite pronouns
- **B2:** Subjunctive variations (imperfect, future)

### Recommended Path Forward

**Phase 1 (Immediate):** Add 15-20 questions to address critical B1 gaps and A1 vocabulary gaps. This will bring coverage from 65% to ~75% and significantly improve diagnostic reliability for intermediate learners.

**Phase 2 (Near-term):** Add 10-15 questions to strengthen under-represented units (those with only 1 question). This will reduce measurement error and increase diagnostic confidence.

**Phase 3 (Ongoing):** Minor refinements to scenario clarity in tense/ser-estar questions. This is low-priority as current issues are minor.

### Final Note

This is a **high-quality diagnostic instrument** that effectively assesses Portuguese proficiency across A1-B2 levels. With the recommended additions (25-35 questions), it would achieve comprehensive syllabus coverage while maintaining its current pedagogical strengths.
