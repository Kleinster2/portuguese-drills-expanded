## 🚀 Quick Start for Claude Code Sessions

**To load this methodology at the start of any session, simply say:**

```
Read PEDAGOGY.md
```

Or:

```
Read and apply the principles from PEDAGOGY.md
```

I will then internalize all principles and be ready to apply them to any question design or restructuring tasks.

## Core Pedagogical Principles

### 1. **Self-Introduction First ("eu" before all others)**

**Principle:** Start with "eu" (first person) and use that to introduce a series of units around prepositions, ser/estar, regular verbs, etc. Only after mastering "eu" do we introduce other subjects.

**Progression:**
1. **Phase 1:** Pure "eu" focus - complete self-introduction toolkit
2. **Phase 2+:** Introduce other subjects in order:
   - "ele/ela" - describing others' introductions
   - "você" - addressing others directly
   - "a gente" - group activities (informal "we")
   - "nós" - formal "we"
   - "vocês" - you all
   - "eles/elas" - they

**Rationale:** Students move from self-introduction → describing others → addressing others naturally.

---

### 2. **Conjugation-Pattern Pedagogy (Singular Before Plural)**

**Principle:** Finish introducing ALL singular pronouns and everything that conjugates in the singular BEFORE moving on to the plural.

**Singular Subjects (Master First):**
- eu (I)
- você (you - singular, formal)
- ele/ela (he/she)
- a gente (we - informal, conjugates as 3rd person singular)
- alguém (someone)
- ninguém (no one)
- todo mundo (everyone)

**Checkpoint:** Unit 40 = 100% singular subjects mastered

**Plural Subjects (Introduce After Checkpoint):**
- nós (we - formal)
- vocês (you all)
- eles/elas (they)

**Rationale:** Singular conjugation patterns are simpler and more common. Mastering singular before plural reduces cognitive load and builds solid foundation.

---

### 3. **Implicit Subjects (Pronoun Dropping)**

**Principle:** After introducing "eu" thoroughly, teach that "eu" can be dropped (implicit subjects).

**Teaching Sequence:**
1. Introduce with explicit "eu": "Eu moro em São Paulo"
2. Practice extensively with explicit subject
3. Then introduce implicit form: "Moro em São Paulo"
4. Explain that Portuguese often drops pronouns when context is clear

**Rationale:** Students understand the conjugation pattern before learning shortcuts.

---

### 4. **Each Subject Introduction is Its Own Unit**

**Principle:** Each new pronoun/subject type deserves dedicated introduction in its own unit.

**Examples:**
- Unit for introducing "ele/ela"
- Separate unit for introducing "você"
- Dedicated unit for "a gente"
- Unit for indefinite pronouns (alguém, ninguém, todo mundo)

**Rationale:** Prevents overwhelming students with multiple subjects at once. Allows focused practice with each new subject type.

---

### 5. **Grammar in Service of Communication**

**Principle:** Don't teach grammar mechanics in isolation. Always contextualize within meaningful communication goals.

**Application:**
- Definite articles taught through "I have THE dog" (self-introduction context)
- Adjective agreement taught through "I have a tall friend" (describing relationships)
- All grammar serves the goal of self-introduction in Phase 1

**Anti-Pattern:** Teaching "the boy is here" just to demonstrate articles when it doesn't serve self-introduction goals.

**Rationale:** Students learn grammar as a tool for real communication, not as abstract rules.

---

### 6. **Centrality Ranking for Vocabulary**

**Principle:** Prioritize universal, high-frequency vocabulary over situational vocabulary.

**The Self-Introduction Trinity (Most Central -ar Verbs):**
1. **morar** - Where you live (everyone lives somewhere)
2. **falar** - What you speak (language ability is fundamental)
3. **trabalhar** - Where you work (most adults work)

**Less Central Verbs:**
4. **estudar** - What you study (only students, situational)
5. **ficar** - Where you stay (less common than morar)

**Application:** Units 7-9 form the trinity with dedicated, parallel structure. Less central verbs come after or are deprioritized.

**Rationale:** Teach what everyone needs first, situational vocabulary second.

---

### 7. **Parallel Unit Structure for Related Concepts**

**Principle:** When teaching related concepts, use parallel structure across units.

**Example - The Trinity (Units 7-9):**
- Unit 7: morar (C + P questions, same structure)
- Unit 8: falar (C + P questions, same structure)
- Unit 9: trabalhar (C + P questions, same structure)

**Benefits:**
- Students recognize patterns
- Reduces cognitive load
- Creates coherent learning narrative

---

### 8. **Frequency Over Grammar Complexity**

**Principle:** "Gostar" (to like) is more important than "precisar" (to need) even though both use "de".

**Application:**
- Gostar taught in Phase 1 (Unit 19)
- Precisar moved to Phase 2 (Unit 25)

**Rationale:**
- Expressing preferences is more fundamental than expressing needs
- Daily usage frequency matters more than grammatical similarity
- Natural acquisition order

---

### 9. **Pure Phase Focus**

**Principle:** Each phase should have clear, unified focus without violations.

**Phase 1 Achievement:**
- 100% "eu" focus (32/32 questions)
- 0% violations (no você/ele/ela/generic nouns in core content)
- Complete self-introduction toolkit

**Rationale:** Mixed subjects break learning narrative and violate "self-introduction first" principle.

---

### 10. **Comprehension Before Production (But Not Too Much)**

**Principle:** Balance comprehension and production appropriately for level.

**Phase 1 Balance:**
- Comprehension: 21.9% (7 questions)
- Production: 78.1% (25 questions)

**Phase 2 Balance:**
- Comprehension: 7.6% (6 questions)
- Production: 92.4% (73 questions)

**Rationale:** Beginners need more comprehension to build confidence. As students advance, shift toward active production.

## Design Guidelines

### Question Design

1. **Chips (Multiple Choice Options):**
   - Average 10 options per question
   - Include plausible distractors:
     - Different verb persons (sou/és/é/somos/são)
     - Different verb tenses (present/past/future)
     - Similar verbs (ser/estar/ficar)
     - Related prepositions (de/do/da/em/no/na)

2. **Comprehension Questions:**
   - Show complete, natural Portuguese sentences
   - Focus on "eu" in Phase 1
   - 6 options for multiple choice
   - Test meaning recognition, not just translation

3. **Production Questions:**
   - Test active recall and conjugation
   - Blanks require selecting correct form from chips
   - Focus on forms students will use immediately

### Unit Organization

1. **Phase 1 (A1 - Beginner):**
   - Units 1-19: Core self-introduction
   - Unit 21: Transitional (less central content)
   - Total: 30-32 questions

2. **Phase 2 (A2 - Elementary):**
   - Units 22+: Introduce other subjects
   - Expand verb tenses (preterite focus)
   - Introduce pronouns (reflexive, object)

3. **Unit Gaps Are Intentional:**
   - Not all numbers 1-21 need to exist
   - Gaps allow for future expansion
   - Focus on logical grouping, not sequential numbering

---

## Question Conversion Guidelines

### When to Convert a Question

Convert when it violates Phase 1's "pure eu" focus:
- Uses você, ele, ela as subject
- Uses generic nouns (the boy, the girls)
- Doesn't serve self-introduction goals

### How to Convert

1. **Subject-only changes:**
   - "You have a house" → "I have a house"
   - "He likes to study" → "I like to study"

2. **Subject + content changes:**
   - "The boy is here" → "I have the dog" (teaches same grammar)
   - "The tall boy" → "I have a tall friend" (teaches same agreement)

3. **Test focus changes:**
   - "Eu trabalho __ hospital" (testing preposition) → "Eu __ no hospital" (testing verb)

### What NOT to Change

- Don't sacrifice grammar teaching objectives
- Don't make conversions that lose pedagogical value
- Ensure chips remain appropriate for new question

---

## Key Metrics to Track

### Phase 1 Metrics
- ✅ "Eu" questions: Should be 100%
- ✅ Comprehension/Production ratio: ~20/80
- ✅ Converted questions: Track count and type
- ✅ The Trinity coverage: Units 7-9 complete

### Phase 2+ Metrics
- Subject distribution (track all pronouns)
- Indefinite pronoun coverage (alguém, ninguém, todo mundo)
- Checkpoint: 100% singular before plural introduction

---

## Evolution Notes

### Major Changes Log

**2025-01-06:**
1. Pure self-introduction transformation (9 questions converted)
2. Gostar/Precisar swap (frequency over similarity)
3. -ar verb restructuring (The Trinity established)
4. Ficar deprioritization (centrality ranking applied)

---

## Quick Reference: Decision Framework

When making changes to questions or units, ask:

1. **Does it serve self-introduction in Phase 1?** If no, move it or convert it.
2. **Is it singular or plural?** Singular comes first.
3. **How central is this vocabulary?** Most central gets priority.
4. **Does it maintain pure "eu" focus in Phase 1?** If no, convert or remove.
5. **Is the grammar taught in meaningful context?** If no, recontextualize.
6. **Do related units have parallel structure?** If no, align them.
7. **Is the frequency appropriate for the level?** High-frequency first.

## Teaching Philosophy Summary

> "Start with self. Master singular. Teach in context. Prioritize frequency. Build systematically."

The student should be able to introduce themselves completely and confidently before learning to talk about others. Every grammatical concept should serve this communicative goal, taught in order of universal applicability and daily usage frequency.
