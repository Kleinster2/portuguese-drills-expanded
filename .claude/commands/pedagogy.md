# Load Pedagogy

Read and internalize the pedagogical methodology from PEDAGOGY.md file in the project root. This document contains all core principles for Portuguese drill design including:

- Self-introduction first ("eu" before all others)
- Conjugation-pattern pedagogy (singular before plural)
- Grammar in service of communication
- Centrality ranking for vocabulary
- The Self-Introduction Trinity (morar, falar, trabalhar)

After reading PEDAGOGY.md, confirm understanding of the key principles and be ready to apply them to any question design or restructuring tasks.
