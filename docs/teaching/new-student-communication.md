# Communication with New/Prospective Students

## Initial Reply to Inquiry

When a prospective student reaches out (typically via email, often referred by Idlewild or other contacts):

### Structure

1. Warm greeting — acknowledge how they found you without over-emphasizing the referral source
2. Note any existing language background as an advantage (e.g., Spanish foundation)
3. State offerings: in-person (NYC) and online (Zoom)
4. State rates clearly — separate prices for in-person vs online; mention session length (up to 90 min); note that materials and follow-up exercises are included
5. Offer a free introductory meeting (in-person or Zoom, at their convenience) before committing to lessons
6. Ask for their availability
7. Sign off: "Abraços (warm regards), Gil"

### Style

- Keep it concise — acknowledge, offer, price, next step
- Don't over-explain or over-emphasize the referral source
- Don't assume a regular schedule upfront — let them suggest times
- Tone: warm but not effusive, professional but not stiff
- No bold text, no emojis in the email body
- "Abraços" as a culturally appropriate sign-off, with English translation for non-Portuguese speakers

### Example

> Hi [Name],
>
> Thanks so much for your message! I'd be glad to help you [and your partner/group] get started with Portuguese [context if relevant, e.g., "as you prepare for your move to Brazil"].
>
> Since you have a background in [relevant language], you're already starting with a solid foundation. I can guide you through the key similarities and differences, helping you build confidence with Brazilian Portuguese from the start.
>
> I offer both in-person lessons in New York City and online sessions via Zoom. My rate for a [two-person / individual] in-person lesson is $[XX] per session. For online classes, the rate is $[XX] per session. Each session runs up to 90 minutes. All sessions include materials and follow-up exercises.
>
> I'd be happy to arrange an in-person or Zoom meeting at your convenience before scheduling a lesson. No charge for that, of course.
>
> Please let me know what days and times work best for you.
>
> Abraços (warm regards),
> Gil

## Scheduling Reply

When a student follows up to schedule (especially after a delay):

- Acknowledge the delay lightly if applicable ("no problem at all with the timing")
- Don't make too much of their apology
- Confirm availability simply
- If meeting somewhere new, be flexible ("meeting in [location] is no problem at all")
- Ask them to propose a specific spot/time

## Post-Class Follow-Up

After a class, send a follow-up email with:

1. Warm greeting in Portuguese ("Olá [names]!")
2. Brief encouragement on progress
3. Attached class materials (PDFs worked on during the session)
4. Links to relevant GPT drills with brief usage guidance
5. Supplementary recommendations (Netflix series, Language Reactor extension, etc.)
6. Offer to connect on WhatsApp as an additional way to communicate and share things between classes
7. Invite questions and sign off with "Abraços, Gil"

### GPT Drill Guidance

When sharing GPT drills, include practical tips:
- Which tense to focus on (e.g., "ask it to show only present-tense questions")
- That it can be asked about related topics (vocabulary, grammar)
- That they can try reasoning models (o3, o4 mini) to see how answers are explained
- The drills check automatically — no need to wait for correction

## General Principles

- Emails are the primary channel; WhatsApp is offered as an additional option for sharing things
- No pressure on scheduling — let students propose times
- Free intro meeting before first paid lesson
- Always include materials and follow-up in the session price
- Holiday greetings are appropriate when timely
