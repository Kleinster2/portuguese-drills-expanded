### Student: Marvin (B2, European Portuguese)

**Session Review (Feb 3):**
- Worked on "Família de palavras" exercise (textbook p.204, exercise 15-6)
- Word derivation: noun ↔ adjective ↔ adverb ↔ verb conversions
- No issues reported - handled the material well

**Curriculum Decision:**
This exercise type is valuable for vocabulary depth. Created two new drills:
- `word-families-b1` - Regular derivation patterns for intermediate learners
- `word-families-b2` - Complex patterns with prefixes, irregular families for advanced learners

**Rationale:**
Word families build morphological awareness, helping students:
- Expand vocabulary efficiently (learn 4 words from 1 root)
- Recognize unfamiliar words by identifying roots
- Improve spelling through pattern recognition
