# -ar Verb Restructuring - The Self-Introduction Trinity

**Date:** 2025-01-06
**Status:** Complete
**Impact:** 3 questions modified, 2 questions moved, all Phase 1 renumbered

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 has been restructured to prioritize the **three most central -ar verbs for self-introduction**: **morar, falar, trabalhar**. The less central verbs **estudar** and **ficar** have been deprioritized, with ficar moved to Unit 21 (transitional) and estudar remaining but positioned after the core trinity.

## The Problem

### Original Structure Issues

**Units 7-11 previously had:**
- Unit 7: morar (live) ✅ CENTRAL
- Unit 8: falar (speak) ✅ CENTRAL
- Unit 9: em/no/na prepositions (using trabalhar as vehicle) ⚠️ CENTRAL but underemphasized
- Unit 10: estudar (study) ⚠️ LESS CENTRAL (only for students)
- Unit 11: ficar (stay) ⚠️ LEAST CENTRAL (less common in intros)

### Centrality Analysis

**Universal (everyone says this in an introduction):**
1. **morar** - Everyone lives somewhere → "Eu moro em São Paulo"
2. **trabalhar** - Most adults work → "Eu trabalho no hospital"
3. **falar** - Language ability is fundamental → "Eu falo português"

**Situational (only some people say this):**
4. **estudar** - Only students or people actively studying
5. **ficar** - Less common in basic introductions ("where I stay" vs "where I live")

### Specific Problems

1. **trabalhar lacked dedicated focus:**
   - Unit 9 used trabalhar merely as a vehicle to teach em/no/na prepositions
   - Students didn't get focused practice on trabalhar conjugation
   - The unit was about prepositions, not the verb itself

2. **Less central verbs got too much emphasis:**
   - estudar had a full dedicated unit despite being situational
   - ficar had a full dedicated unit despite being least central for intros

## The Solution

### New Structure: The Self-Introduction Trinity

**Units 7-9 now form the core -ar verb trinity:**

#### **Unit 7: morar (live)** - Where you live
- Q16 (C): Eu moro em São Paulo → I live in São Paulo
- Q17 (P): Eu __ no Rio → moro
- **Teaching focus:** First-person conjugation + location

#### **Unit 8: falar (speak)** - What languages you speak
- Q18 (C): Eu sempre falo português → I always speak Portuguese
- Q19 (P): Eu __ espanhol → falo
- **Teaching focus:** First-person conjugation + direct objects

#### **Unit 9: trabalhar (work)** ⭐ **NOW DEDICATED UNIT**
- Q20 (C): Eu trabalho no banco todos os dias → I work at the bank every day
- Q21 (P): Eu __ no hospital → trabalho ⭐ **MODIFIED**
- **Teaching focus:** First-person conjugation + workplace (reinforces em/no/na naturally)

**Key change to Q21:**
- **Was:** "I work inside the hospital → Eu trabalho __ hospital" (testing preposition "no")
- **Now:** "I work at the hospital → Eu __ no hospital" (testing verb "trabalho")

---

### What Happened to Less Central Verbs?

#### **estudar - Kept in Phase 1 (Unit 10)**
- Q22 (C): Eu estudo português todos os dias → I study Portuguese every day
- Q23 (P): Eu __ inglês → estudo
- **Rationale:** Still useful for many learners, comes after core trinity

#### **ficar - Moved to Unit 21 (Transitional)**
- Q31 (P): Eu __ em casa → fico (was Q24)
- Q32 (P): Eu __ aqui → fico (was Q25)
- **Rationale:** Less central to self-introduction, positioned as "extended" content

## Question Renumbering

To maintain logical flow, all questions after Q23 were renumbered:

| Old Q# | New Q# | Unit | Topic |
|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Q24 | Q31 | 21 | Ficar - "I stay at home" |
| Q25 | Q32 | 21 | Ficar - "I stay here" |
| Q26 | Q24 | 12 | Ser vs Estar - Comprehension |
| Q27 | Q25 | 12 | Ser vs Estar - Production |
| Q28 | Q26 | 13 | Prepositions with Location |
| Q29 | Q27 | 16 | Ter - "I have a house" |
| Q30 | Q28 | 16 | Ter - "I have two brothers" |
| Q31 | Q29 | 19 | Gostar de - "I like music" |
| Q32 | Q30 | 19 | Gostar de - "I like to study" |

## New Phase 1 Structure

### **Phase 1 Core (Units 1-19): Q1-Q30 (30 questions)**

**Self-Introduction Components:**
1. Identity (Unit 1: Ser)
2. Origin (Unit 2: de/do/da)
3. Possession - Articles (Units 3-4: Definite/Indefinite)
4. Location/State (Unit 5: Estar)
5. Description (Unit 6: Adjective Agreement)
6. **Where I live** (Unit 7: morar) ✅
7. **What I speak** (Unit 8: falar) ✅
8. **Where I work** (Unit 9: trabalhar) ✅
9. What I study (Unit 10: estudar)
10. States (Unit 12: Ser vs Estar)
11. Location prepositions (Unit 13)
12. What I have (Unit 16: Ter)
13. What I like (Unit 19: Gostar de)

### **Unit 21 - Ficar (Transitional): Q31-Q32 (2 questions)**

**Purpose:** Less central, extended self-introduction content

### **Phase 2 (Units 22+): Q33+**

**Purpose:** Introduce other subjects (você, ele/ela, a gente)

## Pedagogical Achievement

### Before Restructuring:
- ❌ trabalhar used as mere vehicle for preposition teaching
- ❌ Less central verbs (estudar, ficar) over-emphasized
- ❌ No clear "trinity" of core self-introduction verbs

### After Restructuring:
- ✅ **The Self-Introduction Trinity** (morar, falar, trabalhar) clearly established
- ✅ Each trinity verb has dedicated unit with parallel structure
- ✅ trabalhar now gets proper emphasis as core self-introduction verb
- ✅ Less central verbs (estudar, ficar) appropriately positioned
- ✅ Logical progression: where I live → what I speak → where I work

---

## Student Outcomes

After Units 7-9, students can confidently introduce themselves with the three most universal statements:

```
Eu moro em São Paulo.        (I live in São Paulo)
Eu falo português.           (I speak Portuguese)
Eu trabalho no hospital.     (I work at the hospital)
```

These three verbs form the backbone of any self-introduction in Portuguese.

## Files Modified

### Core Data:
- **config/placement-test-questions-grammar-v1.0.json**
  - Q21 modified: Changed from preposition test to trabalhar conjugation test
  - Q24-Q25 moved: From Unit 11 to Unit 21
  - Q24-Q32 renumbered: To maintain logical sequence

### Documentation:
- **docs/AR_VERB_RESTRUCTURING.md** (this file)

---

## Summary Statistics

### Phase 1 Composition:
- **Core Phase 1 (Units 1-19):** 30 questions
- **Unit 21 (Transitional):** 2 questions
- **Total questions in extended Phase 1:** 32

### -ar Verbs in Phase 1:
- **Core trinity:** morar, falar, trabalhar (Units 7-9)
- **Situational:** estudar (Unit 10)
- **Transitional:** ficar (Unit 21)

## Conclusion

The restructuring establishes a clear pedagogical hierarchy:
1. **Most central:** morar, falar, trabalhar (everyone needs these)
2. **Situational:** estudar (useful for many, but not universal)
3. **Extended:** ficar (less common in basic introductions)

This aligns with the principle of teaching the most universally applicable vocabulary first, ensuring students can construct complete, natural self-introductions before moving to less common expressions.
