## Detailed Conversions

### **Unit 3: Definite Articles** (Q6-Q7)

**Before:**
- Q6: "The boy is here" → __ menino está aqui (O)
- Q7: "The girls are here" → __ meninas estão aqui (As)

**After:**
- Q6: "I have the dog" → Eu tenho __ cachorro (o)
- Q7: "I have the books" → Eu tenho __ livros (os)

**Rationale:**
- Still teaches definite articles (o/a/os/as)
- Now in context of possessions ("I have THE...")
- Creates contrast with Unit 4's indefinite articles ("I have A...")
- More relevant to self-introduction

---

### **Unit 6: Adjective Agreement** (Q14-Q15)

**Before:**
- Q14: "The tall boy" → O menino __ (alto)
- Q15: "The tall girls" → As meninas __ (altas)

**After:**
- Q14: "I have a tall friend" → Eu tenho um amigo __ (alto)
- Q15: "I have tall friends" → Eu tenho amigas __ (altas)

**Rationale:**
- Still teaches gender agreement (amigo/alto) and number agreement (amigas/altas)
- Avoids speaker gender assumption ("I am tall" would require alto OR alta)
- Uses relational context (describing friends) which is part of self-introduction
- "Amigo/amiga" is basic early vocabulary

---

### **Unit 11: Ficar** (Q24-Q25)

**Before:**
- Q24: "The house is located far" → A casa __ longe (fica)
- Q25: "You stay at home" → Você __ em casa (fica)

**After:**
- Q24: "I stay at home" → Eu __ em casa (fico)
- Q25: "I stay here" → Eu __ aqui (fico)

**Rationale:**
- Both teach "ficar" for location/state
- Now uses first-person conjugation consistently
- More relevant to describing one's habits

---

### **Simple Subject Conversions** (Q28, Q29, Q32)

**Q28 (Unit 13):**
- Before: "He is currently at work" → Ele está __ trabalho
- After: "I am at work" → Eu estou __ trabalho

**Q29 (Unit 16):**
- Before: "You have a house" → Você __ uma casa
- After: "I have a house" → Eu __ uma casa

**Q32 (Unit 19):**
- Before: "He likes to study" → Ele gosta __ estudar
- After: "I like to study" → Eu gosto __ estudar

**Rationale:**
- Same grammar teaching objectives
- Simply changed subject from você/ele to eu
- Maintains self-introduction focus
