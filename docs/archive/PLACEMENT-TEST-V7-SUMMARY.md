# Portuguese Placement Test V7.0 - Pragmatic Redesign Summary

## Overview

**Complete redesign** of the Portuguese placement test using **pragmatic question allocation** based on what each unit actually needs to test, replacing the rigid 90 units × 2 questions = 180 questions structure.

## Files Created

1. **placement-test-v7-allocation-plan.txt** - Complete unit-by-unit analysis and allocation strategy
2. **placement-test-questions-v7.0-pragmatic.json** - New question bank (demonstration version)
3. **PLACEMENT-TEST-V7-SUMMARY.md** - This summary document

## Core Philosophy Change

### Old Approach (v6.3)
- **Rigid Rule**: Every unit gets exactly 2 questions (1 comprehension + 1 production)
- **Result**: 90 units × 2 = 180 questions
- **Problem**: Forces artificial questions that don't test the actual principle

### New Approach (v7.0)
- **Pragmatic Rule**: Allocate questions based on WHAT NEEDS TESTING
- **Result**: ~215 questions with intelligent distribution
- **Benefit**: Every question tests something meaningful

## Question Allocation Strategy

### Category 1: Pure Grammar Units (15 units)
**Allocation**: 0-1 comprehension + 3-5 production

**Examples**:
- Unit 2 (Contractions): 0C + 4P - Tests ALL 4 contractions (do, da, dos, das)
- Unit 3 (Articles): 0C + 4P - Tests ALL 4 articles (o, a, os, as)
- Unit 6 (Adjectives): 0C + 4P - Tests ALL 4 forms (masc/fem × sing/pl)

**Rationale**: Grammar rules have multiple variations that MUST be tested individually. One example isn't sufficient.

### Category 2: Vocabulary/Meaning Units (35 units)
**Allocation**: 3-5 comprehension + 0-1 production

**Examples**:
- Unit 14 (Family): 4C + 0P - Tests multiple family members (pai, mãe, irmão, irmã)
- Unit 30 (Question Words): 5C + 1P - Tests all question words (onde, quando, como, por que, o que)
- Unit 60 (Locations): 5C + 1P - Tests location prepositions (em cima de, embaixo de, ao lado de, etc.)

**Rationale**: Vocabulary units have multiple items to recognize. Production of all items is redundant.

### Category 3: Balanced Verb Units (15 units)
**Allocation**: 1 comprehension + 1-2 production

**Examples**:
- Unit 7 (Morar): 1C + 1P - Basic regular verb conjugation
- Unit 8 (Falar): 1C + 1P - Basic regular verb conjugation
- Unit 16 (Ter): 1C + 2P - Important irregular verb

**Rationale**: Simple verbs just need basic testing of understanding + conjugation ability.

### Category 4: Complex Tense/Mood Units (15 units)
**Allocation**: 1-2 comprehension + 2-4 production

**Examples**:
- Unit 82 (Present Subjunctive): 1C + 4P - Test across verb types (-AR, -ER, -IR, nós form)
- Unit 84 (Imperfect Subjunctive): 2C + 3P - Complex form needs context + multiple verbs
- Unit 36 (Ser/Ir Preterite): 2C + 3P - Confusing irregular forms (fui = went/was)

**Rationale**: Complex conjugation patterns need more production questions to test mastery.

### Category 5: Recognition-Only Units (15 units)
**Allocation**: 1-2 comprehension + 0 production

**Examples**:
- Unit 15 (Negation): 2C + 0P - Simple word order recognition
- Unit 17 (Age): 1C + 0P - Just idiomatic expression
- Unit 18 (Yes/No Questions): 2C + 0P - Intonation recognition

**Rationale**: Just need to recognize/understand structure, not actively produce.

### Category 6: Usage/Nuance Units (5 units)
**Allocation**: 2-3 comprehension + 1-2 production

**Examples**:
- Unit 11 (Ficar): 2C + 2P - Multiple meanings (location, stay, become)
- Unit 42 (Por vs Para): 3C + 2P - Complex usage distinction
- Unit 80 (Todo vs Tudo): 2C + 1P - Common confusion

**Rationale**: Need multiple examples to show WHEN to use which option.

## Comparison: V6.3 vs V7.0

### Example Units - BEFORE & AFTER

#### Unit 2: Origin with Contractions
**V6.3** (1C + 1P):
- Comp: "Eu sou do Brasil" → Doesn't test contraction principle, just translates
- Prod: "I am from the United States" → Eu sou __ Estados Unidos → dos

**V7.0** (0C + 4P):
- Prod Q1: Brazil → do (de+o, masculine singular)
- Prod Q2: Argentina → da (de+a, feminine singular)
- Prod Q3: United States → dos (de+os, masculine plural)
- Prod Q4: Philippines → das (de+as, feminine plural)

**Improvement**: Tests ALL 4 contractions instead of just one. Eliminates artificial comprehension question.

#### Unit 6: Adjective Agreement
**V6.3** (1C + 1P):
- Comp: "A casa grande" → Tests nothing about agreement
- Prod: "The small books" → Os livros __ → pequenos (only masc plural)

**V7.0** (0C + 4P):
- Prod Q1: Tall boy → alto (masculine singular)
- Prod Q2: Tall girl → alta (feminine singular)
- Prod Q3: Tall boys → altos (masculine plural)
- Prod Q4: Tall girls → altas (feminine plural)

**Improvement**: Tests ALL 4 gender/number combinations instead of just one.

#### Unit 30: Common Question Words
**V6.3** (1C + 1P):
- Comp: One question word example
- Prod: One question word test

**V7.0** (5C + 1P):
- Comp Q1: Onde você mora? → "Where do you live?"
- Comp Q2: O que você faz? → "What do you do?"
- Comp Q3: Quando você trabalha? → "When do you work?"
- Comp Q4: Como você está? → "How are you?"
- Comp Q5: Por que você estuda? → "Why do you study?"
- Prod Q6: "Where do you live?" → __ você mora? → Onde

**Improvement**: Tests EACH question word individually instead of arbitrary selection.

#### Unit 82: Present Subjunctive (Regular Verbs)
**V6.3** (1C + 1P):
- Comp: One subjunctive example
- Prod: One subjunctive production

**V7.0** (1C + 4P):
- Comp Q1: "Espero que você fale" → "I hope you speak"
- Prod Q2: "I hope you speak" → fale (-AR verb)
- Prod Q3: "I hope you eat" → coma (-ER verb)
- Prod Q4: "I hope you leave" → parta (-IR verb)
- Prod Q5: "Maybe we travel" → viajemos (nós form)

**Improvement**: Tests subjunctive across all 3 verb types (-AR, -ER, -IR) and multiple persons.

#### Unit 14: Family Members
**V6.3** (1C + 1P):
- Comp: One family member
- Prod: Forced production (not really testing placement level)

**V7.0** (4C + 0P):
- Comp Q1: Meu pai trabalha → "My father works"
- Comp Q2: Minha mãe estuda → "My mother studies"
- Comp Q3: Meu irmão mora aqui → "My brother lives here"
- Comp Q4: Minha irmã fala português → "My sister speaks Portuguese"

**Improvement**: Tests multiple family vocabulary items. Eliminates artificial production requirement.

| Usage/Nuance | 5 | 15-20 | Mixed |
| **TOTAL** | **90*** | **~215** | **~47% C / 53% P** |

*Unit 90 eliminated as redundant

## Key Improvements

### 1. Complete Grammar Coverage
- **Before**: Unit 2 tests 1 of 4 contractions
- **After**: Unit 2 tests ALL 4 contractions (do, da, dos, das)

- **Before**: Unit 6 tests 1 of 4 adjective forms
- **After**: Unit 6 tests ALL 4 forms (alto, alta, altos, altas)

### 2. Proper Vocabulary Coverage
- **Before**: Unit 30 tests 1 question word
- **After**: Unit 30 tests ALL 5 major question words

- **Before**: Unit 14 tests 1 family member
- **After**: Unit 14 tests 4 family members

### 3. Expanded Complex Grammar
- **Before**: Present subjunctive = 1C + 1P
- **After**: Present subjunctive = 1C + 4P (tests -AR, -ER, -IR, nós)

- **Before**: Imperfect subjunctive = 1C + 1P
- **After**: Imperfect subjunctive = 2C + 3P (context + multiple verbs)

### 4. Elimination of Artificial Questions
- **Before**: Forced comprehension for Unit 2 that doesn't test contractions
- **After**: 0 comprehension, 4 production questions that DO test contractions

- **Before**: Forced production for Unit 14 (family vocabulary)
- **After**: 4 comprehension only - appropriate for vocabulary

### 5. Strategic Efficiency
- **Before**: Unit 90 "Comprehensive Synthesis" adds 2 redundant questions
- **After**: Unit 90 eliminated - entire test is already comprehensive

## Demonstration Version (v7.0-pragmatic.json)

The created file includes **45 questions** covering representative units:

### Included Units:
- **Units 1-8**: Complete Phase 1 foundation (articles, contractions, adjectives, basic verbs)
- **Unit 10**: Additional basic verb example
- **Units 14-15**: Vocabulary and recognition examples
- **Unit 30**: Question words (Category 2 demonstration)
- **Unit 82**: Present subjunctive (Category 4 demonstration)

### Full Version Would Include:
- All 89 units (90 minus eliminated Unit 90)
- ~215 total questions
- Complete coverage of all phases (A1 → B2)

## Usage Notes

### For Full Implementation:

1. **Expand the demonstration file** to include all units following the allocation plan
2. **Maintain distractor quality**:
   - Comprehension: 6-7 strategic options
   - Production: 8-10 strategic chips
3. **Preserve metadata compatibility** with existing test infrastructure
4. **Test progressive difficulty** - ensure harder units remain in later phases

### Compatibility:

- JSON structure fully compatible with v6.3
- Same metadata fields
- Same question format (comprehension vs production)
- Can be dropped into existing test engine

## Recommendation

**Deploy v7.0** for significantly improved placement test quality:
- ✓ More accurate placement (tests actual competencies)
- ✓ Better coverage (all grammar variations tested)
- ✓ More efficient (vocabulary tested appropriately)
- ✓ No artificial questions (every question meaningful)
- ✓ Appropriate difficulty progression

The demonstration file proves the concept. Full implementation would follow the same methodology across all 89 units.
