### Testing

**Automated CI/CD Pipeline:**
- All tests run automatically on push and pull requests via GitHub Actions
- Tests must pass before merge is allowed
- View results in the "Actions" tab on GitHub

**Running Tests Locally:**

```bash
# Run all tests (Python + JavaScript)
npm test

# Run Python tests only
python utils/test_consistency.py

# Run JavaScript tests only (requires Playwright)
npm run test:js

# Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
npm run test:install
```

**What the Tests Validate:**
- ✅ Python annotation engine (v2.0) - 17 test cases
- ✅ JavaScript annotation engine (v2.0) - 17 test cases
- ✅ Cross-platform consistency (Python === JavaScript)
- ✅ All 6 pronunciation rules working correctly
- ✅ No Rule 1b regressions (words ending in -or should NOT be annotated)

**Test Files:**
- `utils/test_consistency.py` - Python test suite
- `test-consistency.html` - JavaScript test suite (browser-based)
- `utils/test-js.mjs` - Node.js test runner (headless Playwright)
- `.github/workflows/test-pronunciation.yml` - CI/CD configuration

**Before Submitting a Pull Request:**
1. Run `npm test` locally
2. Ensure all tests pass
3. Add tests for any new pronunciation rules
4. Update test expectations if changing annotation behavior
