# Session Notes - January 2025

## Session: 2025-01-XX (Current)

### Issues Fixed
1. **Ser vs Estar drill loading wrong drill**
   - **Problem**: JSON parsing error due to literal newlines in ser-estar.json
   - **Fix**: Replaced literal newlines with `\n` escape sequences
   - **Commit**: `a1bcc42` - Fixed ser-estar.json, imperative.json, subject-identification.json
   - **Files**: `config/prompts/ser-estar.json`, `config/prompts/imperative.json`, `config/prompts/subject-identification.json`

2. **Added answer chips to ser-estar drill**
   - **Implementation**: Shows all 8 conjugation forms as chips every time
   - **Format**: `[CHIPS: sou, estou, é, está, somos, estamos, são, estão]`
   - **Ambiguous cases**: Also includes "both" as 9th option
   - **Commits**:
     - `d98f683` - Initial chips implementation
     - `c40076a` - Ensure somos/estamos included
     - `3af26fc` - Show all 8 chips every time
   - **Files**: `config/prompts/ser-estar.json`

3. **Session not found error when clicking chips**
   - **Problem**: Cloudflare Workers stateless architecture loses in-memory sessions
   - **Root cause**: Client wasn't sending message history for stateless fallback
   - **Fix**: Added `messages: messageHistory` to API requests
   - **Commit**: `cc32e38`
   - **Files**: `index.html` (sendChatMessage function, lines 1238-1250)

### Documentation Created
4. **Comprehensive project documentation**
   - **PROJECT_README.md** - High-level overview, architecture, quick start
   - **CODEMAP.md** - Detailed file locations with line numbers
   - **.sessions/** - Working notes directory
   - **Purpose**: Help AI assistants understand project faster in future sessions

### Key Learnings
- JSON configs MUST use `\n` escape sequences, not literal newlines (causes parse errors)
- Cloudflare Workers are stateless - sessions don't persist between requests
- Client must send full message history to support server's stateless fallback
- Answer chips system uses [CHIPS:] marker detection and parsing

### Current State
- 47 drills all loading correctly
- Ser-estar drill has interactive chips (all 8 forms)
- Session management working with stateless fallback
- Comprehensive documentation in place
