# .sessions/ Directory

This directory contains working notes, session logs, and development documentation that persists across AI conversations.

**Important**: This directory is git-ignored to keep your working notes private and to avoid cluttering the repository.

## Files

- **session-2025-01.md** - Current session notes (January 2025)
- **known-issues.md** - Current bugs, limitations, and workarounds
- **future-improvements.md** - Ideas and feature requests for later
- **recent-changes.md** - What changed recently (last 5-10 sessions)

## Usage

### For Developers
Add notes here as you work. These files are meant to be messy and evolving - don't worry about polish.

### For AI Assistants
Read these files at the start of each session to understand:
- What we worked on recently
- Current issues and their status
- Ideas for future work

## Tips

- Date your notes (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Link to commits when relevant (use short hash)
- Keep it concise but detailed enough to be useful later
- Move old session notes to archive/ subdirectory when they're no longer relevant
