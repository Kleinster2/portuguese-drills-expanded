# V7.0 Detailed Improvements - Before & After Examples

## 5 Key Units Showing Dramatic Improvements

### 1. Unit 2: Origin with Contractions (de + article)

#### V6.3 - BEFORE (1C + 1P)
```
COMPREHENSION Q1:
  PT: "Eu sou do Brasil"
  Question: "What does 'do' mean in 'Eu sou do Brasil'?"
  Answer: "from the (de + o)"

  PROBLEM: This tests knowledge of the translation, not the ability to
           USE the contraction principle. Student could get this right
           without knowing da, dos, or das.

PRODUCTION Q2:
  EN: "I am from the United States"
  Template: "Eu sou __ Estados Unidos"
  Answer: dos

  PROBLEM: Only tests 1 of 4 contractions. Doesn't verify student knows
           do, da, or das.
```

#### V7.0 - AFTER (0C + 4P)
```
PRODUCTION Q1:
  EN: "I am from Brazil"
  Template: "Eu sou __ Brasil"
  Answer: do
  Tests: de + o = do (masculine singular)

PRODUCTION Q2:
  EN: "I am from Argentina"
  Template: "Eu sou __ Argentina"
  Answer: da
  Tests: de + a = da (feminine singular)

PRODUCTION Q3:
  EN: "I am from the United States"
  Template: "Eu sou __ Estados Unidos"
  Answer: dos
  Tests: de + os = dos (masculine plural)

PRODUCTION Q4:
  EN: "I am from the Philippines"
  Template: "Eu sou __ Filipinas"
  Answer: das
  Tests: de + as = das (feminine plural)

IMPROVEMENT:
  ✓ Tests ALL 4 contractions systematically
  ✓ Eliminates artificial comprehension question
  ✓ Student must demonstrate mastery of complete paradigm
  ✓ Proper placement test - can they actually USE the rule?
```

### 2. Unit 6: Adjective Agreement

#### V6.3 - BEFORE (1C + 1P)
```
COMPREHENSION Q1:
  PT: "A casa __"
  Question: "Which is correct? 'A casa __'"
  Options: [grande, grandes, grando, granda, GRANDE, grand]
  Answer: grande

  PROBLEM: Tests invariable adjective (grande doesn't change).
           Doesn't test gender/number agreement at all!

PRODUCTION Q2:
  EN: "The small books"
  Template: "Os livros __"
  Answer: pequenos

  PROBLEM: Only tests masculine plural. Doesn't verify student knows
           pequeno, pequena, or pequenas.
```

#### V7.0 - AFTER (0C + 4P)
```
PRODUCTION Q1:
  EN: "The tall boy"
  Template: "O menino __"
  Answer: alto
  Tests: Masculine singular adjective agreement

PRODUCTION Q2:
  EN: "The tall girl"
  Template: "A menina __"
  Answer: alta
  Tests: Feminine singular adjective agreement

PRODUCTION Q3:
  EN: "The tall boys"
  Template: "Os meninos __"
  Answer: altos
  Tests: Masculine plural adjective agreement

PRODUCTION Q4:
  EN: "The tall girls"
  Template: "As meninas __"
  Answer: altas
  Tests: Feminine plural adjective agreement

IMPROVEMENT:
  ✓ Tests complete 2×2 paradigm (gender × number)
  ✓ Uses variable adjective (alto/alta/altos/altas)
  ✓ Student must know ALL forms, not just one
  ✓ Eliminates misleading comprehension with invariable adjective
```

### 3. Unit 30: Common Question Words

#### V6.3 - BEFORE (1C + 1P)
```
COMPREHENSION Q1:
  (Whatever single question word happened to be chosen)

PRODUCTION Q2:
  (Whatever single question word happened to be chosen)

PROBLEM: Unit is called "Common Question Words" (plural) but only
         tests ONE question word. Student could know "onde" but not
         "quando", "como", "por que", or "o que" and still pass.
```

#### V7.0 - AFTER (5C + 1P)
```
COMPREHENSION Q1:
  PT: "Onde você mora?"
  Answer: "Where do you live?"
  Tests: onde = where

COMPREHENSION Q2:
  PT: "O que você faz?"
  Answer: "What do you do?"
  Tests: o que = what

COMPREHENSION Q3:
  PT: "Quando você trabalha?"
  Answer: "When do you work?"
  Tests: quando = when

COMPREHENSION Q4:
  PT: "Como você está?"
  Answer: "How are you?"
  Tests: como = how

COMPREHENSION Q5:
  PT: "Por que você estuda?"
  Answer: "Why do you study?"
  Tests: por que = why

PRODUCTION Q6:
  EN: "Where do you live?"
  Template: "__ você mora?"
  Answer: Onde
  Tests: Active recall of most common question word

IMPROVEMENT:
  ✓ Tests ALL 5 major question words individually
  ✓ Each gets comprehension verification
  ✓ Appropriate allocation: vocabulary = comprehension-heavy
  ✓ Unit name matches actual content
```

### 4. Unit 82: Present Subjunctive - Regular Verbs

#### V6.3 - BEFORE (1C + 1P)
```
COMPREHENSION Q1:
  PT: "Espero que você fale"
  Answer: "I hope you speak"

PRODUCTION Q2:
  (Whatever single verb happened to be chosen)

PROBLEM: Present subjunctive is HARD. Different endings for -AR, -ER,
         -IR verbs, plus different persons. Testing just one example
         doesn't verify mastery of the subjunctive paradigm.
```

#### V7.0 - AFTER (1C + 4P)
```
COMPREHENSION Q1:
  PT: "Espero que você fale"
  Answer: "I hope you speak"
  Tests: Recognition of subjunctive construction

PRODUCTION Q2:
  EN: "I hope you speak"
  Template: "Espero que você __"
  Answer: fale
  Tests: -AR verb subjunctive (falar → fale)

PRODUCTION Q3:
  EN: "I hope you eat"
  Template: "Espero que você __"
  Answer: coma
  Tests: -ER verb subjunctive (comer → coma)

PRODUCTION Q4:
  EN: "I hope you leave"
  Template: "Espero que você __"
  Answer: parta
  Tests: -IR verb subjunctive (partir → parta)

PRODUCTION Q5:
  EN: "Maybe we travel"
  Template: "Talvez nós __"
  Answer: viajemos
  Tests: Different person (nós) subjunctive

IMPROVEMENT:
  ✓ Tests subjunctive across ALL 3 verb types (-AR, -ER, -IR)
  ✓ Tests multiple persons (você, nós)
  ✓ Complex grammar gets appropriate depth
  ✓ Can actually place student's subjunctive mastery level
```

### 5. Unit 14: Family Members

#### V6.3 - BEFORE (1C + 1P)
```
COMPREHENSION Q1:
  PT: "Minha mãe, meu pai"
  (Some question about family)

PRODUCTION Q2:
  EN: (Forced production of family vocabulary)

PROBLEM: Vocabulary units don't need production testing for placement.
         If student recognizes "meu pai" = "my father", that's sufficient
         for placement level. Forcing production is artificial.
```

#### V7.0 - AFTER (4C + 0P)
```
COMPREHENSION Q1:
  PT: "Meu pai trabalha"
  Answer: "My father works"
  Tests: pai = father + meu = my

COMPREHENSION Q2:
  PT: "Minha mãe estuda"
  Answer: "My mother studies"
  Tests: mãe = mother + minha = my

COMPREHENSION Q3:
  PT: "Meu irmão mora aqui"
  Answer: "My brother lives here"
  Tests: irmão = brother

COMPREHENSION Q4:
  PT: "Minha irmã fala português"
  Answer: "My sister speaks Portuguese"
  Tests: irmã = sister

IMPROVEMENT:
  ✓ Tests multiple family vocabulary items
  ✓ Appropriate allocation for vocabulary (comprehension-heavy)
  ✓ Eliminates artificial production requirement
  ✓ More efficient use of test time
  ✓ Each question tests distinct vocabulary item
```

- **Increase**: +130% more questions for same units
- **Better Coverage**: Testing went from partial to comprehensive

### Qualitative

#### Unit 2 (Contractions)
- Before: 25% coverage (1 of 4 forms tested)
- After: 100% coverage (all 4 forms tested)

#### Unit 6 (Adjectives)
- Before: 25% coverage + misleading comprehension
- After: 100% coverage (all 4 forms tested)

### Strategic Benefits

1. **No More Artificial Questions**
   - V6.3 Unit 2 comp question didn't test the principle
   - V6.3 Unit 6 comp question used invariable adjective
   - V7.0 eliminates all artificial questions

2. **Complete Paradigm Testing**
   - Grammar rules now tested across all variations
   - Students can't "pass" knowing only partial patterns

3. **Appropriate Method Selection**
   - Vocabulary: Comprehension (efficient recognition testing)
   - Grammar: Production (must demonstrate active usage)
   - Complex: Expanded (adequate depth for difficulty)

4. **Better Placement Accuracy**
   - V6.3: Student could pass Unit 2 knowing only "dos"
   - V7.0: Student must know all 4 contractions to pass
   - Result: More accurate placement at appropriate level

## Recommendation

**Deploy V7.0** for these 5 units alone would improve:
- **Unit 2**: From 25% to 100% contraction coverage
- **Unit 6**: From misleading to comprehensive adjective testing
- **Unit 30**: From 20% to 100% question word coverage
- **Unit 82**: From minimal to substantial subjunctive coverage
- **Unit 14**: From artificial to appropriate vocabulary testing

**Full V7.0 deployment** across all 89 units would replicate these improvements throughout the entire test, resulting in significantly more accurate student placement.
