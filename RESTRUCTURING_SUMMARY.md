# Portuguese Curriculum Restructuring Summary

## Date: 2025-11-04

## Changes Made

### Units Deleted (2)
- **OLD Unit 63**: Question Words Consolidated (duplicate of Unit 34) - DELETED
- **OLD Unit 74**: Por vs Para (duplicate of Unit 38) - DELETED

### Major Moves

#### Numbers Moved Earlier (Pedagogical Improvement)
- **OLD Unit 44** → **NEW Unit 15**: Numbers 0-20 (Cardinal Numbers - Foundation)
- **OLD Unit 45** → **NEW Unit 16**: Numbers 21-100 (Extending the System)
- **OLD Unit 46** → **NEW Unit 17**: Age Expression (Tenho X anos)

**Rationale**: Numbers are high-frequency vocabulary needed early for ages, counting, telling time, dates, etc.

#### Progressive Tenses Moved After Future (Pedagogical Improvement)
- **OLD Unit 75** → **NEW Unit 30**: Progressive Tenses - Estar + Gerund (Estou Fazendo)

**Rationale**: Progressive tenses (estar + gerund) are very common in Brazilian Portuguese and should be introduced right after the future tense, which is at Unit 29.

## Cross-References Updated

All cross-references throughout the document were updated to reflect new unit numbers, including:
- References to Numbers units (44-46 → 15-17)
- References to Progressive unit (75 → 30)
- References to Question Words (63 → 38 for original, 63 remains for Frequency Adverbs)
- Various other unit cross-references adjusted for the cascading renumbering

## Final Statistics

- **Total units before**: 78
- **Total units after**: 75 (excluding template Unit X)
- **Units deleted**: 2
- **Units moved**: 4 (Numbers 0-20, 21-100, Age, Progressive)
- **Units renumbered**: 73 units had their numbers updated

## Pedagogical Improvements

1. **Early Number Introduction**: Students now learn numbers early (Units 15-17) instead of waiting until Unit 44-46, enabling them to:
   - Express ages immediately after learning possessives
   - Count and quantify early in their learning journey
   - Better prepare for dates, time, and prices

2. **Progressive After Future**: Progressive tenses now appear right after future tense (Unit 30, after Unit 29), reflecting their high frequency in Brazilian Portuguese and logical pedagogical sequence.

3. **Duplicate Removal**: Eliminated exact duplicate units that caused confusion and wasted learning time.
